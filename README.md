# COVID-19-Analysis

In this analysis, we looked at COVID-19 mortality and comorbid conditions that contributed to the death rate due to COVID-19. The data looked at different demographic and geographic regions throughout the United States. The purpose of the analysis was to discover any trends, pattrerns, and insights in Covid mortality and any factors that lead to increased mortality due to Covid. 

# **Project Overview**
The analyses in this project were performed using real-world data on COVID-19 death rates obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Census Bureau. The primary analysis was to try and understand what impact, if any, various short-term and chronic medical conditions have on Covid mortality rates. 

# **Repository Structure**
*  01 Project Management: Contains the project brief which outlines the objectives and expectations of the analysis.
*  02 Data: Contains a PDF file with links to the datasets and files used in the analysis.
*  03 Scripts: Includes all Python scripts used in the data analysis, structured in Jupyter Notebooks.
*  04 Analysis/Visualizations: Contains image files of the visualizations generated during the analysis.
*  05 Final Report: Includes the Tableau Public storyboard as a PDF file, available to view on Tableau Public here.

# **Key Questions Addressed**
*  Which conditions are most strongly associated with COVID-19 deaths?
*  How do COVID-19 death rates vary across different states and age groups?
*  What are the geographical patterns in COVID-19 death rates and contributing conditions across the United States?
*  How can linear regression and clustering analyses be used to predict and understand COVID-19 mortality?
*  What are the temporal trends and seasonal patterns in COVID-19 deaths and contributing conditions?
